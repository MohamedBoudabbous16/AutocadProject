House Design Project

This project is a complete architectural design created using AutoCAD for 2D planning and 3D modeling software for visualizations. The design focuses on spatial arrangements, structural details, and overall layout for a residential building, showcasing the use of CAD tools and 3D modeling for an accurate representation of the planned structure.
Project Overview

    Project Type: Residential House Design
    Software Used: AutoCAD for 2D plans, 3D modeling software for visual renderings
    Skills Demonstrated:
        CAD proficiency for precise architectural planning
        3D modeling for structural visualization

Project Details

    2D Architectural Plans:
        Created detailed floor plans, including room dimensions, wall placements, door and window positions, and utilities.

    3D Modeling:
        Modeled the design in 3D, adding depth and perspective for a more comprehensive visualization of the space.
        Rendered realistic views to provide insights into the layout, structural details, and visual aesthetics.

Installation and Usage

To view the AutoCAD files:

    Download the .dwg files and open them in AutoCAD or any compatible software.
    For 3D model viewing, you can use software compatible with the provided model format (e.g., .3ds, .obj).

File Structure

    /2D_Plans: Contains 2D AutoCAD .dwg files for floor plans.
    /3D_Model: Contains 3D model files compatible with various 3D rendering applications.
